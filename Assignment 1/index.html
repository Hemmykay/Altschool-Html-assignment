          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
              My journey into the world of code began in 2018, sparked by a friend's Facebook post about an online coding course. Intrigued, I dove into the world of programming, eager to explore this new landscape. My initial forays were with SoloLearn, where I enthusiastically jumped between languages, from Python to JavaScript, driven by a thirst to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
              During this time, I also joined the CodeLagos initiative, which provided a valuable opportunity to learn alongside other aspiring developers at the Mirror Hub, fostering a collaborative and supportive learning environment. I briefly considered front-end engineering, though my efforts remained scattered.
          </p>
          <p>
              In 2019, I was admitted to Lagos State University to study Mechanical Engineering. The demanding curriculum, however, left little time to nurture my budding programming skills. The rigorous coursework required my full attention, and my coding journey was put on hold.
          </p>
          <p>
              Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 lockdown provided an unexpected opportunity. With the world on pause, I returned to my passion for programming. This time, I focused on back-end development, exploring PHP and delving into the Laravel framework.
          </p>
          <p>
              As the world began to reopen and university sessions resumed, I once again paused my PHP and Laravel studies to dedicate myself to my Mechanical Engineering degree. Finally, in 2024, I completed my BSc.
          </p>
          <p>
              Now, with my degree in hand, I am ready to fully commit to my passion for programming.

          <h2>Why AltSchool?</h2>
          <p>
            While I explored coding independently, I realized I needed a more structured and
            focused environment to truly hone my skills and establish a solid
            career path in engineering. This realization led me to  AltSchool. I
            believe their program will provide the dedicated learning
            experience and direction I need to achieve my goals.
